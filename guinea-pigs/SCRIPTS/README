I love coding. I don't know myself about how much I love coding.
One day I was at the budget hotel. 
I needed to get up early to catch my flight.
My phone was run out of battery. 
No telephone service from my room. 
No internet. 
No alarm clock.
My laptop didn't have alarm clock system.
How could I get up early without these things?

So at the end I decided to write an alarm script in ruby.
Since then when I get into trouble, I start writing a code.

I gather all my short scripts in here. My aim is to share among others and reuse it when it is needed.


~ Enjoy coding ~
